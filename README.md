# DIAGNO-VISTA
Diabetes Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project presents a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using clinical data. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving model checkpoints for future use. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and improve healthcare decision-making through data-driven insights.

Project Workflow
Loading and exploring the diabetes dataset

Cleaning and preprocessing data (handling missing values, scaling)

Building predictive machine learning models

Evaluating models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Saving model checkpoints to enable reuse without retraining

Objectives
Build an accurate model for early diabetes prediction

Improve prediction through feature engineering and preprocessing

Save the model for efficient future predictions
